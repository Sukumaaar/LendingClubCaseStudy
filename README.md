## General Information
-You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

-If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

-If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

-The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- With higher interest rate increases the risk of charge off
- Charge off proportion is high for small bussiness loans
- Charge off proportion is high when home ownership is not clear
- Lower the annual income higher is the charge off proportion
